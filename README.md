### SYNOPSIS <a name=synopsis></a>
   xmatchview, xmatchview-conifer and xmatchview-hive are imaging tools for visualizing DNA/RNA sequence synteny. It allows users to align 2 (or 3) sequences in FASTA format using cross_match, minimap2 or any aligners with .paf output capabilities, and displays the alignments in a variety of image formats (png, tiff). xmatchview-hive outputs xml-scalable vector graphics (svg)

## xmatchview-hive
![Logo](https://github.com/warrenlr/xmatchview/blob/master/xmv-h.png)

   xmatchview, xmatchview-conifer and xmatchview-hive are written in python and run on linux and windows. They serve as visual tools for analyzing cross_match and minimap2 alignments. Cross_match (Green, P. (1994) http://www.phrap.org) uses an implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for comparing DNA sequences that is sensitive.

### INSTALLATION <a name=install></a>

Download the tar file and extract the files on your system using:

<pre>
tar -xvf xmatchview_1-2-5.tar 
</pre>

To install this package with Conda, run one of the following:
<pre>
conda install -c bioconda xmatchview
conda install -c "bioconda/label/cf201901" xmatchview
</pre>

### DEPENDENCIES <a name=dep></a>
-------------

<pre>
xmatchview and xmatchview-conifer:

You will need to do the following before you can proceed:
      1) Download python3 from: http://www.python.org/  (The code was tested on python 3.7+)
      2) Download the Python Imaging Library (PIL) from: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
      3) Either use PIL or true type fonts (ttf) and specify the full path to the font directory in xmatchview.py and xmatchview-conifer.py with the -p option. The fonts used by xmatchview and xmatchview-conifer include:

        arial.ttf
        arialbd.ttf
        arialbi.ttf
        -or-
        helvR14.pil
        helvR18.pil
        helvB18.pil
        helvBO18.pil
        helvB24.pil
        helvR24.pil
        helvB24.pil

        If fontpaths are not provided (not recommended), default fonts will be used to preserve code functionality. However, these systems fonts are very small and of limited utility. To download the above fonts, simply search the internet for "arial.ttf", "arialbd.ttf" and "arialbi.ttf". For convenience, they are included in the "fonts.tar" file in this directory. The "helv*.pil" fonts are distributed with PIL.

      4) Download cross_match for academic use, see http://www.phrap.org and http://www.phrap.org/consed/consed.html#howToGet
      5) Make sure cross_match is in your $PATH

* Files for the -q, -r and -s options must include header_names:base_length, with names that correspond to those in fasta files used to run cross_match or minimap2
</pre>
! Ensure the config.txt file exists in your run directory

Notes:

xmatchview-hive; you must create a config.txt file with the following information:
axis_number:name:length(bp)
<pre>
1:name1
2:name2
3:name3
</pre>
Keep names short (< 10 characters)

An example config.txt is provided for your convenience in the "test-hive" folder (See TEST section below)
Axis labels are shown in the diagram below. Also, when running cross_match/minimap2, align in this order:
<pre>
1 vs. 2
1 vs. 3
3 vs. 2

  1
  |
 / \
3   2


The text files supplied in -q -r -s are simply:
sequence name:base length

The sequence name must correspond to those in the fasta files used to run cross_match or minimap2

example perl-oneliner to convert:

cat genome1.fa | perl -ne 'chomp;if(/^\>(\S+)/){ $head = $1;if($prev ne $head && $prev ne ""){print "$prev:$seq\n";$seq="";}  $prev=$head;}else{ $seq += length($_); }if(eof()){ print "$prev:$seq\n";  } ' > genome1.txt

run as : -q genome1.txt

</pre>


xmatchview and xmatchview-conifer;

Files for the -s and -q options must correspond to fasta files used to run cross_match or minimap2.  Those files should each contain a single, non-justified, sequence (no line breaks).

fasta file format:
<pre>
>yourSequence
AATAGCAGCTACGACGACGCAGCGCGACGTTTCATCAA...AATACAGACGCGACGACGCAGCATCATCGAGAC
</pre>

* A 10th column may be added to the GFF files supplied via -e/-y to specify the color of a feature (default feature color is yellow or black, for xmatchview and xmatchview-conifer, respectively). Users may specify any of these color names: yellow, blue, cyan, green, lime, red, sarin, forest, dirtyred, dirtyyellow, grey, lightgrey, orange, beige, black, white. Examples of .gff files are provided in the accompanied ./test folder 


Users can control whether to show the position of sequence features on the reference and query (*-e* and *-y* options), show co-linear blocks of a certain length (*-b* option) when their mismatch rates are below a threshold (*-m* option). The histogram is generated by moving a sliding window with a step length (*-r* recommended between 10-50). The color space in xmatchview is RGBA and the alpha channel is used for visualizing the relationship between co-linear blocks (*-a* option, transparent to solid, 0 to 255).

</pre>


### TEST xmatchview.py / xmatchview-conifer.py / xmatchview-hive.py <a name=test></a>
-------------
To test your xmatchview install on your system, we provide a test folder where you can run xmatchview and xmatchview-conifer, using the shell script commands below. If all goes well, and you used the arial fonts provided, the image you generate should be identical to:

./test/xmv-FTL1_pa.fa_vs_FTL1_ss.fa.rep_m10_b10_r1_c2_success.png
./test/xmvconifer-FTL1_pa.fa_vs_FTL1_ss.fa.rep_m10_b10_c2_success.png

Once you confirmed that it works as expected, you may explore the full range of parameters to test functionality (see USAGE above) 


At the unix prompt, once the package is installed, change directory to:
<pre>
cd ./test
</pre>
Once you have downloaded pyhon and PIL and changed the paths to fonts in the xmatchview.py and xmatchview-conifer.py
Execute:
<pre>
./runXMV.sh FTL1_pa.fa_vs_FTL1_ss.fa.rep FTL1_pa.fa FTL1_ss.fa 200 10 2 FTL1_pa.gff FTL1_ss.gff
and
./runXMV-conifer.sh FTL1_pa.fa_vs_FTL1_ss.fa.rep FTL1_pa.fa FTL1_ss.fa 200 10 2 FTL1_pa.gff FTL1_ss.gff
</pre>

To test xmatchview-hive:
<pre>
cd ./test-hive
# cross_match (.rep output)
../xmatchview-hive.py -q 2019-nCoV.txt -r SARS-CoV.txt -s MERS-CoV.txt -x 2019-nCoV.fa_vs_SARS-CoV.fa.rep -y 2019-nCoV.fa_vs_MERS-CoV.fa.rep -z MERS-CoV.fa_vs_SARS-CoV.fa.rep -e SARScds.gff -i 0 -b 1 -c 30 -a 0.75
</pre>

If all went well, images such as those provided in the test folder should be generated
